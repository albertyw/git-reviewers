Finders
-------

`git-reviewers` is componsed of a set of strategies for generating lists of
reviewers, or Finders.  They return a weighted set of reviewers which is then
sorted and recommended to you.  They include:

- `FindLogReviewers` - Generate a list of reviewers based on committers to
  your committed (but not merged with master) files
- `FindHistoricalReviewers` - Generate reviewers based on the repository
  committers as a whole
- `FindArcCommitReviewers` - Generate reviewers based on arc commit messages
  for files which you have modified on your branch

Configuration
-------------

`git-reviewers` supports reading configuration from a configuration file
with the `--json` flag.  The configuration file accepts json with the
following fields (all fields optional):

```json
{
    "verbose": false,
    "copy": false,
    "ignore": ["a", "b", "c"],
    "base_branch": "master"
}
```

`git-reviewers` will also by default search for and load a json
configuration file at `~/.git/reviewers`.

Development
-----------

```bash
python setup.py develop
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
ruff check .
mypy .
coverage run -m unittest
coverage report -m
```

Publishing
----------

```bash
pip install twine
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
twine upload dist/*
```
